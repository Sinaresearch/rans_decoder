rANS verilog README

Author: Sina Lindseth

This project is a hardware acceleration of a rANS decoder that is implemented in Verilog for simulation on Modelsim. The testbench includes some encoded sample text that is decoded under simulation.

It is based on the work of rygrans https://github.com/rygorous/ryg_rans, which implements rans in software using a variety of novel methods.

The readme in each folder describes how to build the different parts of the project.


The simulator is Modelsim altera starter edition.
